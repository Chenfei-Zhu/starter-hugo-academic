abstract: The invention discloses a suspension system for realizing height adjustment of a vehicle body. The system includes a mandrel and an adjustment chamber, the two ends of the mandrel are fixed to the body, the adjusting cavity sleeves the mandrel, and the left and right sides of the adjusting cavity are connected with blade shock absorbers. A longitudinal arm is connected to that outer end of the blade shock absorbers on the left and right sides. The blade shock absorber and a longitudinal arm sleeve the mandrel. A torsion bar spring is connected between the left blade shock absorber and the right side longitudinal arm and between the right blade shock absorber and the left side longitudinal arm respectively, the lower end of the longitudinal arm is used for connecting with the wheel, the adjusting cavity drives the blade shock absorbers on both sides to rotate, and the blade shock absorbers on both sides drive the corresponding longitudinal arms to rotate around the mandrel through the torsion bar spring. The system realizes the automatic adjustment of the height of the car body, has the function of damping the vibration of the car body, so that the car body platform can adapt to allkinds of complex terrain, and realize the functions of climbing, crossing ditches, mountain driving and so on.
