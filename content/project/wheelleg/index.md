In this project, I proposed a novel quadruped wheeled foot separated mobile robot based on arm active suspension by combining quadruped bionics and arm suspension structure. The main contributions are as follows:

• Proposed a novel quadruped wheeled-foot separated mobile robot based on a special active suspension with adjustable height by analyzing quadruped bionics.\
• Designed and modeled the overall structure, wheel and foot assembly, steering system, and power and control system of the robot.\
• Calculated the key parameters of the power and control system; selected and arranged electronic components such as robot joint motor, hub motor, and battery on the robot designed.\
• Implemented Finite Element Analysis and Motion Analysis on the robot in simulation to verify the reliability of the structure designed.
