The main contribution of this project is:

• Proposed a novel network architecture, shifted attention regression network (SARN), which is characterized by shifted attention heatmap and soft input aggregation, to perform accurate, robust and unbiased 3D hand pose estimation (HPE) for medical application. \
• Built a hand movement dataset (PAKH) based on Parkinson’s finger tapping test (FTT) by conducting experiments on 17 subjects. PAKH contains 26k depth images collected by a Intel RealSense D435i depth camera with 2 hand joint annotations.  \
• Proposed method outperforms or achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets: NYU, ICVL and MSRA datasets, and achieves low error on predicting joint position and all task-specific metrics on PAKH, which indicates that the proposed method can perform accurate and robust HPE and has the potential for medical applications.
