In this project, we proposed, designed, and manufactured a kind of special suspension structure whose height can be adjusted based on the road condition through an electromagnetic way. The main contributions of this project are as follows:

• Proposed a new suspension structure, utilized SolidWorks to make a 3D model of that suspension consists of above 100 parts, improved models through structure optimization and finite element analysis.\
• Designed a control system including a controller, motors, valves, etc., coded in C to achieve adjustable damping and adjustment of body height.\
